####Results of Chvatal-Sankoff constants with parameter n = 100000 and 1 <= k <= 26.

k = 1; constant = 1.0
k = 2; constant = 0.81203
k = 3; constant = 0.71713
k = 4; constant = 0.6539
k = 5; constant = 0.60735
k = 6; constant = 0.57007
k = 7; constant = 0.54004
k = 8; constant = 0.51496
k = 9; constant = 0.49325
k = 10; constant = 0.47404
k = 11; constant = 0.45721
k = 12; constant = 0.44219
k = 13; constant = 0.42936
k = 14; constant = 0.41783
k = 15; constant = 0.40662
k = 16; constant = 0.39577
k = 17; constant = 0.38627
k = 18; constant = 0.37753
k = 19; constant = 0.36983
k = 20; constant = 0.36189
k = 21; constant = 0.35526
k = 22; constant = 0.34874
k = 23; constant = 0.34242
k = 24; constant = 0.33644
k = 25; constant = 0.33057
k = 26; constant = 0.32523

According to the results with parameter n = 100000 (for each k from 1 to 26, calculate 5 times and use the average to
simulate the expected value), when k >= 9, Chvatal-Sankoff constants would be less than 0.5.
